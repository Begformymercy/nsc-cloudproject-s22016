Today I completed some milestones of connecting my application to the phone's camera as well as
to the gallery.

At this point I need to create a recycler view for the gallery and select multiple images to populate that recycler view.

Also I am ready for the connection to the database to submit images to. At this point I am also ready
to merge my code with my team
